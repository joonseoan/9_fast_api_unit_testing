    [dependency_overrides]
    In FastAPI, `dependency_overrides` is a mechanism that allows  to override the dependencies used 
    in your application during runtime, typically for testing or debugging purposes.
    
    This feature is particularly useful when you want to replace a dependency with a mock or
    a different implementation without modifying the original code.

    How It Works
    Dependencies in FastAPI: FastAPI uses dependency injection to manage dependencies,
    such as database connections, authentication, or other services.
    These dependencies are often defined as functions or classes and injected into route handlers or other dependencies.

    Overriding Dependencies: The dependency_overrides attribute is a dictionary that maps the original dependency 
    (usually a function or class) to a new implementation.
    When you override a dependency, FastAPI will use the new implementation instead of the original one.

    Key Points
    Testing: dependency_overrides is commonly used in unit tests to replace real dependencies 
    (like databases or external APIs) with mock objects or stubs.

    Runtime Override: The overrides are applied at runtime, so you donâ€™t need to modify the original code.

    Scope: The overrides are applied globally for the entire application, 
    so use them carefully to avoid unintended side effects.

    Resetting Overrides
    If you want to reset the overrides (e.g., after a test), you can clear the dependency_overrides dictionary:
    `app.dependency_overrides.clear()`
"""

# get `app` first from `FastAPI` and it has `dependency_overrides dictionary`
# Because it is dictionary, we can map with the function or class name, for instance `get_db`
app.dependency_overrides[get_db] = override_get_db


# [IMPORTANT]
# `get_current_user` is imported into todos.py and then we can directly import here.
# mocking dependency injection `user` in `todos.py`
app.dependency_overrides[get_current_user] = override_get_current_user


# Then we want to connect our client to our `TestClient` with our `app` inside.
# Then, this `app` has now the replacement with overriden and mocked function
client = TestClient(app)

    """
    Why Not Use `db` to Delete the todos?
    The reason the fixture doesn't use `db` to delete the todos is related to `database session lifecycle` and
    `isolation between tests`.

    Database Session Lifecycle:
    The `db` object (TestingSessionLocal()) is a SQLAlchemy session that is created during the setup phase 
    of the fixture.
    
    # [IMPORTANT]
    Once the fixture yields the todo object, the session (db) is no longer in use.
    If you try to use db in the teardown phase, it might not work as expected because the session
    could already be closed or in an invalid state.

    Isolation Between Tests:
    Using engine.connect() to delete all rows in the todos table ensures that the database is cleaned up completely, 
    regardless of the state of the db session.

    This approach guarantees that each test starts with a clean database, which is critical for test isolation.
